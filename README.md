# Mental-Health-Detection-using-EEG-Signals
<hr/>


<h4>Introduction: </h4>
<p>Mental health issues are becoming increasingly common among individuals over the 
age of 16, with academic, social, and career-related stress being the main reasons. 
Traditional mental health assessment methods, such as surveys or counseling, are often 
affected by personal biases or insufficient information. With this in mind, our project presents 
a system that collects and analyzes EEG (electroencephalogram) brain wave graphs across 
different mental states — such as awake, drowsy, and deep sleep. 
<br/>Users upload a multi-page PDF report containing the EEG graph to the system. This 
PDF is then separated into pages, analyzed with the help of a trained machine learning 
model, and the percentage probability of the user’s mental state being normal or abnormal is 
displayed. The system is trained on a dataset of EEG graphs classified by experts. 
<br/>Importantly, this project is not intended to be a substitute for medical diagnosis or 
professional mental health services. Instead, the project seeks to raise awareness and act as a 
link between individuals and mental health professionals, especially for those who may not 
recognize the need for help. The ultimate goal is to make early mental health screening in 
educational institutions more accessible, data-based, and stigma-free. </p>
